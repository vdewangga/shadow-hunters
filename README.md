Shadow Hunters is an online multiplayer game (based on the [board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Hunters) of the same name) in which players assume the identities of characters belonging to three opposing factions. The Shadows, inhabitants of the underworld, aim to destroy all Hunters, while the Hunters, protectors of the mortal realm, seek to banish the Shadows. Neutrals, caught in the crossfire, pursue their own hidden objectives.

As night settles on the ruins of abandoned town at the edge of a mysterious forest, the identities of ally and enemy alike are obscured by a shifting fog, and players must discover who is friend and who is foe before striking from the darkness!
